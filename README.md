Abstract:

Villages occupied a central place in the Indus Civilisation before, during, and after the urban period (Mature Harappan, c. 2600-1900 BC), thus suggesting that rural lifeways were flexible and capable of adaptive transformation. Within the context of the TwoRains research agenda, we aimed at investigating the role of the diversity of cropping strategies in sustaining villages while cities were abandoned.

We present the IndusVillage, an agent-based model representing a population of farming households and its local environment, composed of modules (submodels) corresponding to local-to-regional weather and land systems, food economy, demography, and settlement. Indus Village is an ongoing group effort to integrate hypotheses and data into a single coherent framework. The model is intended to be rigorous, controllable, and intelligible at all stages of development. At the same time, by following a modular design, we aim to guarantee its usefulness to future models and generations of modellers.

In this presentation, we focus on the consolidated parts of the IndusVillage, namely four submodels (Weather, Soil Water, Crop, and Land) and two milestone integrated versions (Land Unit and Land Crop). Despite not covering human-related mechanisms, these models generate results that increasingly approach our main question while highlighting the role of seasonality and local water dynamics in the potential of crop strategies.
